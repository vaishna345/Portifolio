         <!--Summary-->
            <p>Hello! My name is Vaishna Prabhuvenkatesh. 
I am a junior attending Dublin High School in Dublin, California. 
I am currently the President of the DHS Field Hockey Club at my school.
I am a member of National Honor Society(2015-2016) and California Scholarship Federation. Some of the achievements that I have accomplished so far in my high school journey include 
recieving the Honor Pin and 4th place in the Human Animal Biomedical Sciences category in the Alameda County Science Fair. In the future, I aspire to become a user interface designer specializing in fields like bioinformatics and artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>My goal in this field is to do many research projects relating to making medical procedures more technologically advanced and design. 
To achieve this goal, I plan to take courses related to computer science, graphic design, and biology.
I plan to choose bioinformatics as my future career because it combines my love for science and graphic design.</p>
<p>My passions include drawing, multimedia card making and blogging. As I person, I think that I am creative, responsible, and sincere.
My main goal in life is to give back to those around me in every way I can and make the environment a cleaner place.</p>
